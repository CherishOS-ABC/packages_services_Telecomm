In order to hit this situation you will need to be on a call, receive a call, answer call, then choose \"hold current call\" then receive another call, then choose \"hold current call\".\n\nI\u0027m believe we can infer by the user actions it is their intention.  Also, does the underlying framework support multiple held calls?  That is something I am unsure about.  Then we would need a management interface, etc..  I think it\u0027d be too complex",
