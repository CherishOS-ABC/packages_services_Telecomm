      "message": "1) I did try it yesterday (and was tried it before) - once i remove that import, try catch in getPhoneId stop working. Because when i do SIP call android soft-reboot and i checked logcat - there is crash happen because of unhandled NumberFormatException\n2) Could you check PhoneAccountRegistrar.java - there are 4 java.lang imports - why they was added ? I found it was commited there quite far ago https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_services_Telecomm/commit/2a7bc9c81dc8e66be8e7a788a9dade2a34bf245f and other 3 imports was already there.\n\nAnswering to another your comment - I know java and know why we should not import java.lang. But i also trust my eyes and have example in nearest file PhoneAccountRegistrar.",

      "message": "That PhoneAccountRegistrar reference is virtually useless, as the patch in question is a CAF one and they - mildly speaking - in most cases aren\u0027t exactly Java experts.\n\nWhat do you expect the test program at [1] to output? As you might have expected, it reports an exception. If that for whatever reason doesn\u0027t work here, that\u0027s more than weird and must be investigated and understood, not simply papered over.\n\n[1] http://pastebin.com/VHEkVCNc",
